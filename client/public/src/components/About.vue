        <h2> Mission Statement </h2>
        <h3> 
            The Cracked Spines Project is a library database for readers 
            to find and support marginalized authors of various genres. For 
            this particular project, ‘marginalized’ is used to only mean people 
            of color. This is not to deny the fact that white people can be 
            marginalized in other ways, but to acknowledge that the publishing 
            industry often spends the majority of its resources publishing and 
            promoting white authors. The CSP therefore aims to be an easily 
            accessible directory for those interested in reading and supporting 
            marginalized authors of color.
